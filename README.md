# first-mernApp
this app is made for learning react only
it is a simple library app that stores data of some books and authors
users can see the author of a book as well as his/her other books. This is done using graphql

whenever a new data is added, every client will be able to see it. I used socket.io for this
and also react-bootstrap for some styling
